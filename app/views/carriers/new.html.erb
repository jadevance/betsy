<!-- this is a form that shows the variables made in the carriers_controller, and allows the user to choose their perferred shipping rate and company -->


<!-- I'm not really sure if its necessary to initialize t the end of the fetch method in the wrapper in order to reach into the hash/array we got back and seperate the fedex and ups into into new mini arrays that are assigned to the instance variables...if so we can do something like this below and reach into each here, but I'm not sure how.... or we could just pass the @destination_query and iterate over it here. -->


<%= radio_button_tag(:rate, "@fedex.standard %>") %>
<%= label_tag(:shipping_type, "FedEx standard shipping" ) %>
<%= radio_button_tag(:rate, "@fedex.overnight" ) %>
<%= label_tag(:shipping_type, "FedEx overnight shipping") %>
<%= radio_button_tag(:rate, "@ups.standard") %>
<%= label_tag(:shipping_type, "UPS standard shipping") %>
<%= radio_button_tag(:rate, "@ups.overnight") %>
<%= label_tag(:shipping_type, "UPS overnight shipping") %>

<!-- this then goes to the controller ( the method will update the database or go back to our api if we were doing labels and tracking?) and params[:rate] will contain one of the options that they chose-->
<!-- i think this is a post request in the route? -->
